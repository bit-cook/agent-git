# Connect an executor through a cloud relay

The cloud service must provide the peer relay API. Every backend region must either
own the relay or forward peer traffic to the configured relay owner; a router replica
must not keep a private in-memory relay. Desktop and the executor need compatible CLI
builds.

Cloud adapters with a narrower role than the signed-in account can send
`access_ceiling` in executor RPC parameters: `read`, `control`, or `admin`.
`machine.describe` advertises support with `access_ceiling: true`. An adapter must
require that capability before forwarding restricted writes to an executor.
The executor intersects this ceiling with its own resource policy, removes the
parameter before harness dispatch, and retains the resulting caller role through
queue admission and the final session permission checks. A ceiling never grants
access. Omitting it preserves the account's executor policy. This lets a Web
workspace operator stay an operator even if the account also administers the
machine and another controller changes the session's dangerous mode.

On the execution machine, sign in and start the owner daemon. Startup performs peer
registration and enables the owner's Cloud inbound path; no separate enrollment command
is required:

```sh
agit login --hub https://dev.agent-git.com
agit rc start --detach
```

The executor opens outbound presence and data connections. It needs no public RC
listener or inbound SSH route for cloud sessions. Its existing local owner
endpoint and session registry remain authoritative. Use the same `AGIT_HOME` for
daemon and policy commands if choosing an isolated namespace.

On the Desktop machine, sign in to the same cloud with `agit login --hub ...`.
In Desktop, add a cloud machine, enter the cloud origin, enable cloud connections
for the local controller, and select the online executor. Desktop connects
through its local controller and the relay. Private keys and account/device
credentials stay in the daemon namespace; Desktop stores public device identity.

Peer registration grants the signed-in owner machine Admin access unless a
machine rule already exists. Cloud connection permission and executor resource
permission are independent: admission alone does not expose another account's
sessions. The executor owner manages its local resource policy:

```sh
agit rc cloud policy
agit rc cloud grant --hub https://dev.agent-git.com \
  --account <immutable-account-id> --resource session:<session-id> --access read
```

Resource selectors are `machine`, `project:<id>`, and `session:<id>`. Access is
`deny`, `read`, `control`, or `admin`. An explicit native or logical session deny
wins over inherited project or machine access. Owner SSH keeps host-owner
semantics and is outside this cloud delegation policy.

`agit rc cloud status --hub ...` shows the public enrollment;
`agit rc cloud devices --hub ...` lists devices visible to the current account.
Detached startup prints the daemon log path. Structured `diagnostics-*.jsonl`
files under the `desktop-rc` directory retain route generations, worker PIDs,
request correlation, policy revisions, and cloud admission stages without RPC
bodies or credentials. Preserve those files from both endpoints when diagnosing
a failure. After an uncertain mutation outcome, inspect the session and its
receipt before sending a new mutation.

Cloud Web RC can later host the shared controller as a separate endpoint. That
host is not part of the Desktop-to-executor route described here.

## Deployed acceptance runner

`tests/desktop/cloud_live.py` creates isolated local and remote daemon namespaces
and reads a disposable login object from stdin. A `token` login exchanges an
existing access token for an independent test session; cleanup revokes only that
derived session. Codex acceptance uses `ROOT/codex`, or an explicit
`--remote-codex-home` inside `--remote-root`. Configure that isolated home before
running the fixture; the runner never inherits the target user's default Codex
home or copies its authentication files. It exercises a real harness
through the deployed relay, replaces a tunnel worker, checks a second turn's
conversation context, replays events and receipts, and applies an executor
session deny. SSH only prepares and inspects the remote fixture; session RPCs
use the cloud route. The optional `--desktop-test` executable sends another turn
through native Desktop IPC to that same remote harness and verifies its reply.
The runner stops its daemons, revokes its
test devices, signs out its disposable logins, and retains private evidence.
