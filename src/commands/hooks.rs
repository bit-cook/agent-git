//! `agit hooks` — the entry point for runtime hooks (a hidden subcommand).
//!
//! Two actions, one for each of the harness's two kinds of event:
//!
//! * **`ingest` (SessionStart)**: a session starts or switches. It is the **only authoritative
//!   answer** to "which session is running now", see below.
//! * **`settle` (Stop)**: a turn ended, so settle it.
//!
//! Ordinary hook failures stay quiet. Archive settlement errors return failure so lost evidence
//! cannot be acknowledged as saved. `ingest` may return one valid SessionStart JSON response;
//! sessions that are none of agit's business produce no output.
//!
//! # Why SessionStart is authoritative and `AGIT_SESSION` is not
//!
//! `agit new` / `resume` injects `AGIT_SESSION=<owner>/<name>@<branch>` when it starts the runtime.
//! That variable is **process-level**: after the user runs `/resume` or `/clear` inside the claude
//! / codex TUI, the process is the same and so is the variable, while **the actual session has
//! changed**. Settling by it writes session B's content into session A's history — that is data
//! corruption, not a user-experience problem.
//!
//! The two switch paths have different shapes:
//!
//! * `/clear` mints a new session id and a new transcript file on the spot, wholly independent of
//!   the old one;
//! * `/resume` mints no new id: it returns to the id of **the session being resumed** and keeps
//!   appending to that session's original file;
//! * both switches fire SessionStart, with `source` being `clear` / `resume` respectively;
//! * the payload carries the **new** `session_id` and `transcript_path`.
//!
//! So locating always goes through the payload's `session_id` → store link → branch. That path is
//! equally immune to switch paths we did not anticipate, because it asks "which session did the
//! turn just now happen in", not "who was this process started for".
//!
//! # Fixing the in-session environment variable in the same pass
//!
//! claude-code injects `CLAUDE_ENV_FILE` when it runs a SessionStart hook, pointing at
//! `~/.claude/session-env/<session_id>/sessionstart-hook-<n>.sh`; the shell fragment written there
//! is read as the **session environment**, and every tool call after it carries that environment —
//! once a session has been switched, the `AGIT_SESSION` read inside the session is the value
//! written here. Each hook writes its own file and all of them are concatenated, so writing our own
//! does not fight another hook's.
//!
//! So an agent typing `agit commit` by hand inside the session resolves correctly too — leave this
//! half unfixed and the stale value from step 2 keeps lying to the user's face.
//!
//! # Why the action is a subcommand and not an empty argument list
//!
//! `setup --hooks` writes `agit hooks ingest` into settings.json, so the action has to parse as a
//! subcommand: a struct taking no arguments turns every SessionStart into
//! `error: unexpected argument 'ingest'` + exit code 2, silently swallowed by the harness.
//! `ingest` is the default action, so a bare `agit hooks` stays equivalent and an existing
//! settings.json needs no rewrite.
