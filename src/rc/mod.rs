//! `agit rc` — the resident daemon (`agitd`) and everything it needs.
//!
//! # What this is
//!
//! Today a session lives in the terminal that launched it. `agitd` moves the
//! session's *body* to a resident process on the machine and turns every
//! terminal, web page and phone into a *view* of it. Close the laptop lid, the
//! session keeps running; open the web page, you see it where it is.
//!
//! One rule decides every design choice below: **anything that would turn a
//! view back into the body is out** — most obviously "ship the TUI's byte
//! stream to the browser". Byte streams lose structure (which part is a tool
//! call, which is prose), can't render an approval as two buttons on a phone,
//! and — fatal for agit — cannot be committed losslessly. agit's whole value is
//! "structured events → turns → commits", so the daemon speaks structured
//! events end to end.
//!
//! # Topology
//!
//! The standard CLI composes a controller and local executor. The controller
//! depends only on the tunnel client contract; it can be built without this
//! module for a cloud entry service.
//!
//! ```text
//! UI -> controller -> tunnel worker -> peer admission -> executor -> harness
//!       owner RPC -> local executor
//! ```
//!
//! The standard installation contains controller and executor modules, while a
//! Web host can embed only the controller. SSH and Cloud are independent tunnel
//! transports. Cloud admission grants connectivity; executor resource policy
//! independently decides which sessions and operations a principal can access.
//! No Hub-paired execution transport is selected for an unassigned workspace.
//!
//! * The harness's **own transcript file** is the source of truth for completed
//!   items. `agitd` tails it and runs each new line through the same
//!   `adapter::parse` that `agit show` uses, so the live stream is
//!   line-identical to what `agit commit` will snapshot. stdout is used only for
//!   what the file doesn't have: token deltas, approvals, turn results.
//!
//! # Module map
//!
//! | module | job |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`identity`]  | machine fingerprint and display name |
//! | [`mirror`]    | local workspace definitions and path allowlist |
//! | [`policy`]    | allowlist enforcement (canonical paths, no `..`, no symlink escapes) |
//! | [`journal`]   | per-session `seq` allocation, ring buffer, durable watermark |
//! | [`tail`]      | transcript file tailer → `(lineno, raw_line)` |
//! | [`harness`]   | drivers: `claude_code` (stream-json), `codex` (app-server JSON-RPC) |
//! | [`supervisor`]| session registry; turns harness events + tailed lines into protocol frames |
//! | [`cloud`]     | owner enrollment, admission and independent tunnel retries |
//! | [`control`]   | local unix socket for `agit rc status` / `stop` |
//! | [`daemon`]    | wires it all up; the thing `agit rc start` runs |
//!
//! # Why the seq is allocated here and not at the hub
//!
//! Resume-after-disconnect needs a monotonic, gap-free number per stream. Three
//! candidates: the hub, Redis `XADD`, or `agitd`. `agitd` wins because (1) it is
//! the only party that sees the true event order; (2) it keeps numbering while
//! the hub is unreachable, so on reconnect it can say "I'm at 5000, you have
//! 4200, here's the gap"; (3) producer-side numbering gives every consumer an
//! end-to-end hole-detection contract — a dropped frame at any hop is
//! *detected*, not silently lost. Controllers reconcile replay gaps against executor history.
