//! The **only** test for the monotonic danger bit, and the slip that carries it around the
//! daemon.
//!
//! # Why this is a module and not a helper
//!
//! The rule itself is short: **before handing a stretch of harness transcript to anyone, ask
//! whether that transcript ever ran unchecked; the bit that comes back is written into this
//! session, and every `turn.start` / `turn.steer` / `approval.decide` behind `Need::Drive`
//! reads it.**
//!
//! Short, and easy to get wrong on every path — move the test into a helper and the next path
//! that forgets to call it is a miss. Three ways to miss it:
//!
//! * `session.watch` looks a harness-native thread id up in the logical ledger and never finds
//!   anything (a miss);
//! * the takeover half of `session.resume` **mints** a logical id on the spot for a transcript
//!   the ledger does not know, and that id is clean to the ledger forever (a miss);
//! * the logical-id half of `session.resume` does find its own row — but when the same
//!   directory is bound once by each of two workspaces, that row is only **one of** this
//!   transcript's identities, and ws-a's row poisoned while ws-b's row is clean is the
//!   **designed** normal (a miss).
//!
//! What the three share is that "forgetting to call that helper" turns nothing red: the path
//! that was missed runs as usual; it just quietly hands a conversation that ran unchecked to the
//! operator. So this holds not one more helper but **a slip nothing proceeds without**:
//!
//! * [`TranscriptDanger`]'s fields are private, and this module is a **sibling** submodule of
//!   `daemon` (`sessions` / `dispatch` / `guard` cannot reach private fields), so only the three
//!   constructors in this module produce one;
//! * [`Daemon::prepare_spawn`](super::Daemon::prepare_spawn) refuses to launch without one and
//!   stamps `SessionInfo.dangerous` **itself** — the judged bit no longer depends on the caller
//!   remembering to copy it across;
//! * the other two constructors cannot launch a session:
//!   [`TranscriptDanger::fresh_transcript`] ("this run resumes no transcript") and [`judge`]
//!   (read-only following; it judges no caller). `prepare_spawn` confronts the slip with
//!   `spec.resume_from` on the spot, and either of those two together with `--resume` is
//!   refused there rather than quietly let through.
//!
//! So "add a new resume path" either asks the transcript or does not compile / does not launch.
