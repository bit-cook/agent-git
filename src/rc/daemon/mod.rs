//! The daemon proper: wires the link, the journal, the sessions and the control
//! socket together, and stays up.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! ```text
//!            ┌──────────── Daemon ────────────┐
//!  hub ⇄ Link│  journal (seq + ring)          │
//!            │  mirror  (workspaces/allowlist)│
//!            │  sessions: id → mpsc<Command>  │──▶ Session::run (one task each)
//!            └────────────────────────────────┘         │
//!            control.sock (status / stop)               └─▶ AnyDriver + Tailer
//! ```
//!
//! Every frame a session emits goes through the journal — which stamps it with
//! a gap-free `seq` and buffers it for replay — before it reaches the link. So
//! a disconnection cannot lose events: the session keeps running and numbering,
//! and reconnect replays from the ring buffer.
//!
//! # What the daemon refuses to do
//!
//! The hub relays instructions; it does not authorize them. Before acting on
//! any frame the daemon re-checks, locally:
//!
//! * the target workspace belongs to *this* connection (mirror lookup);
//! * the path is inside that workspace's bound projects ([`super::policy`]);
//! * a `fs.readDirectory` stays under `$HOME`.
//!
//! If the hub were compromised, that is the wall.
