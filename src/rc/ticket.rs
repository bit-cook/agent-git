//! The receipt for one instruction: **either it is taken and executed, or it is abandoned and
//! discarded — never both.**
//!
//! # Why it exists
//!
//! The daemon queues an instruction onto a session and then waits for the answer, and that wait
//! must be bounded. It waits under the session's own serial gate, and never while holding the
//! daemon's global state lock.
//!
//! But "time out and forget it" has a trap in each direction, and **both are real**:
//!
//! * **Drop it**: a `SetPermissionMode(bypass)` has already persisted `ever_dangerous` before it
//!   is queued (persist first, widen second — otherwise a roster that cannot be written lets a
//!   session survive a restart running with no checks while the ledger reads clean). Drop the
//!   command and that bit stays true — the session is permanently marked dangerous when nothing
//!   happened in it, and from then on an ordinary operator inexplicably cannot touch it.
//! * **Run it anyway**: the web interface has already received `SessionBusy` and taken it for a
//!   failure, and may have picked a different mode or retried; one `SESSION_REPLY_TIMEOUT` later
//!   that bypass takes effect as a widening nobody expected.
//!
//! The root cause is that **the timeout counts execution when it must only count queueing**: an
//! instruction nobody has picked up yet can be cancelled safely, one already picked up cannot —
//! its side effect is on its way, and the only option is to wait.
//!
//! # How "never both" is guaranteed
//!
//! One three-state atomic, one CAS from each side, **whoever wins decides**:
//!
//! * The executor, on dequeue: `QUEUED → TAKEN`. It executes only if it wins.
//! * The caller, on timeout: `QUEUED → ABANDONED`. It reports failure only if it wins.
//!
//! `reply.is_closed()` alone is not enough: the caller can give up in the window between the
//! check and the start of execution, so it believes nothing ran while it ran. The CAS has no
//! such window — both sides contend for the same cell.
