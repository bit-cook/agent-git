//! The session registry: one live agent session, its harness, and its tailer.
//!
//! # The central design decision: two sources, one truth
//!
//! A driver's stdout and the harness's transcript file describe the same
//! session, but they are good at different things:
//!
//! | | stdout | transcript file |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | token deltas | yes | no |
//! | approvals, interrupt, turn results | yes | no |
//! | exactly what `agit commit` will store | **no** | **yes** |
//!
//! So we use both, for different purposes, and never let them compete:
//!
//! * stdout drives **ephemeral** events — `item.started`, `item.delta`,
//!   `turn.started/completed`, `approval.request`. None of it is persisted.
//! * the file drives **`item.completed`**, the only event the hub stores and the
//!   web renders permanently. Each new line is parsed with the very same
//!   `adapter::parse` that `agit show` uses, and carries its
//!   `transcript::object_hash` — the identical hash the committed envelope will
//!   have. That is what lets the hub reconcile its live projection against the
//!   pushed history line by line, and why "we talked about it on the web but
//!   `agit log` doesn't have it" is structurally impossible.
//!
//! # Redaction happens here, before anything leaves the machine
//!
//! Every event is scrubbed with a `domain::redact::Redactor` carrying this
//! machine's persona plus the daemon's device-local secret filter — the same
//! path `agit export` uses for publishing a copy. That masks secrets (the whole
//! gitleaks rule set plus the registered low-entropy literals), the home
//! directory, the hostname and public IPs.
//! Doing it at the edge rather than at the hub means a leaked key never reaches
//! the network at all.
//!
//! A registered literal is the one thing whose removal also changes the line's
//! advertised identity: keeping the original hash would hand the hub an offline
//! oracle for guessing a low-entropy value. See [`projected_object_hash`].
