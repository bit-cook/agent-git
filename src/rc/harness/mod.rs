//! Harness drivers: how `agitd` speaks to a live coding agent.
//!
//! # Two shapes, deliberately not flattened
//!
//! claude-code and codex both have complete control planes, but they are not the
//! same shape. Flattening them to a lowest common denominator would cost both
//! sides their best feature (codex's protocol-level steer; claude-code's rich
//! `can_use_tool` payload). So each driver reports a [`crate::protocol::RuntimeCapability`]
//! at register time and the frontend renders from that.
//!
//! | | codex | claude-code |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | transport | app-server, JSON-RPC over stdio | `-p --input-format stream-json --output-format stream-json` |
//! | start / resume | `thread/start`, `thread/resume` | `--session-id`, `--resume`, `--fork-session` |
//! | mid-turn steer | `turn/steer` (first-class verb, immediate) | another user message on stdin (lands at the tool boundary) |
//! | interrupt | `turn/interrupt` | `control_request` `{"subtype":"interrupt"}` |
//! | approvals | `item/*/requestApproval` server→client requests | `can_use_tool` control request (needs `--permission-prompt-tool stdio`) |
//! | deltas | `item/agentMessage/delta` etc. | `--include-partial-messages` |
//! | echo own messages | in protocol | `--replay-user-messages` |
//!
//! All of the above was verified against the installed binaries, not read off a
//! doc page — see `docs/rc-harness-probe.md`.
//!
//! # What a driver is responsible for
//!
//! Only the live control plane: start the process, push messages in, pull
//! structured events out, answer approvals, interrupt. It does **not** produce
//! the permanent record — that comes from tailing the harness's own transcript
//! file (see [`super::tail`]), because that file is exactly what `agit commit`
//! snapshots. Keeping those two jobs apart is what guarantees the live view and
//! the committed history can never disagree.
