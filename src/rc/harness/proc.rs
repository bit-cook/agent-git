//! Shared child-process plumbing for the drivers.
//!
//! Both harnesses are NDJSON-over-stdio children. The things that are easy to
//! get wrong are the same for both, so they live here once:
//!
//! * **Own the process tree.** Unix uses `process_group(0)` and group signals;
//!   Windows creates the child suspended, attaches it to a kill-on-close Job,
//!   then resumes it. A harness spawns compilers, test runners, and servers, so
//!   killing only the direct child is never termination proof.
//! * **Drain stderr.** An un-read stderr pipe fills (~64 KiB) and the child
//!   blocks forever. We read it into a bounded tail and surface it on failure.
//! * **Bound the line length.** `BufReader::lines()` has no cap, so a runaway
//!   child can OOM the daemon. We cap and report instead.
//! * **Graceful then forceful.** Close stdin first, then use Unix group signals
//!   or Windows Job termination and wait for both child reap and tree exit.
