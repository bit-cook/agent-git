//! Codex driver over a private stdio executor or a shared native socket.
//!
//! # Why this one is the easier of the two
//!
//! codex ships a real bidirectional protocol. `turn/steer` and `turn/interrupt`
//! are first-class verbs, approvals are server→client requests with typed
//! decisions, and items arrive already structured. Our own hub protocol is
//! deliberately named after it (`turn.steer`, `item.completed`) because that
//! vocabulary has been validated by a real client (the VS Code extension), and
//! copying it keeps a future `codex --remote` interop cheap.
//!
//! # The one trap
//!
//! **codex omits the `"jsonrpc":"2.0"` field on the wire.** Its own
//! `app-server-protocol/src/rpc.rs` says so in a comment ("We do not do true
//! JSON-RPC 2.0, as we neither send nor expect the jsonrpc field"), and the
//! generated schema has no such property. So a strict JSON-RPC parser —
//! `jsonrpsee-types`, for one — cannot read codex traffic at all. We hand-roll
//! a lenient reader here and keep our own strict `"2.0"` on the hub link, where
//! we control both ends.
//!
//! Method names below were read out of `codex app-server generate-ts` on the
//! installed binary (codex-cli 0.147.0), not from documentation.
